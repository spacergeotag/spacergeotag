Find your SDV directory; it's usually 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods

But if your PC doesn't use C:\ as the directory it was installed, try other drive letters ( could be D:\ or E:\ )

Download all of these rars into this folder and select "extract here" on all three.
